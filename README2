# üõ°Ô∏è Keylogger Development (Python)

This project is a **basic educational keylogger** built using Python. It demonstrates system-level scripting and ethical hacking principles in a secure environment for learning purposes.

## üîç Overview
This keylogger captures user keystrokes and logs them securely using encryption. It operates in stealth mode, simulating how keyloggers work in cybersecurity testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Captures all keyboard input.
- Encrypts logs before saving.
- Runs silently in the background.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- `pynput` for listening to keystrokes
- `cryptography.fernet` for encryption

## üöÄ How to Run
```bash
pip install pynput cryptography
python keylogger.py
```

## üìò What I Learned
- Keystroke capturing and monitoring
- Data encryption with Python libraries
- Ethical hacking and security tooling basics
